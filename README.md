# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
## Overview
This is a market historical data for real state valuation collected from Taiwan. The calculation of real state value is a regression Problem. The data contains information about the transaction date, the age of house, the distance to nearest metro station, the number of convenience stores in a living circle on foot, and itâ€™s geographical co-ordinates i.e. latitudes and longitudes.
The output is house price of unit area (10000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping, where Ping is a local unit, 1 Ping = 3.3 meter squared).

## Data Overview
The inputs are as follows
X1=the transaction date (for example, 2013.250=2013 March, 2013.500=2013 June, etc.)
X2=the house age (unit: year)
X3=the distance to the nearest MRT station (unit: meter)
X4=the number of convenience stores in the living circle on foot (integer)
X5=the geographic coordinate, latitude. (unit: degree)
X6=the geographic coordinate, longitude. (unit: degree)

## Univariate Data analysis

X6 longitude
X5 latitude
X4 number of convenience stores
Checking the accuracies for all the models, we have observed that XGBoost has the highest average accuracy of 85.76% followed by Random Forest (85.67%), Decision tree Regressor (83.59%), AdaBoost (83.57%), KNN (82.25%), Multiple Linear Regression (79.91%).

## Recommendatitions
From the predictor significance graph, we can conclude that people are more swayed by the presence of metro station in the neighborhood while making an investment in real-estate.
Real estate properties can be constructed keeping nearest metro station in mind so that more people can be attracted.
The properties can also be priced accordingly i.e. the one near the metro station to be priced higher and the one near the convenience store to be priced lower to attract more customers.
The city planning can be done better to include more metro stations. Metro stations can be constructed keeping in mind that the neighborhoods can have easy access to them.

## Conclusions
The regression models can be used in full fledged business applications and price of the new properties can be approximated based on the information given.

The Model can be deployed on the companies website so that customers can get a approximate values of the property based on the information they provide.

Different models have been used to identify the best suited model (XGBoost) for the application.
