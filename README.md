# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
## Overview
This is a market historical data for real state valuation collected from Taiwan. The calculation of real state value is a regression Problem. The data contains information about the transaction date, the age of house, the distance to nearest metro station, the number of convenience stores in a living circle on foot, and itâ€™s geographical co-ordinates i.e. latitudes and longitudes.
The output is house price of unit area (10000 New Taiwan Dollar/Ping, where Ping is a local unit, 1 Ping = 3.3 meter squared).

## Data Overview
The inputs are as follows
X1=the transaction date (for example, 2013.250=2013 March, 2013.500=2013 June, etc.)
X2=the house age (unit: year)
X3=the distance to the nearest MRT station (unit: meter)
X4=the number of convenience stores in the living circle on foot (integer)
X5=the geographic coordinate, latitude. (unit: degree)
X6=the geographic coordinate, longitude. (unit: degree)

## Univariate Data analysis
### Categorical Variable

The data is equally distributed for all the values, and there is no value which is too low.

### Continuous Variable

After treating outliers the data is equally distributed without much skewness or missing part.

#### Statistical
For continuous predictors we created a correlation matrix and calculated the correlation values for the predictors with respect to the target variables and following values were obtained:

Based on the above correlation values all the three predictors were selected for further action.

#### Statistical
For categorical predictors we used ANOVA test and calculated the P-Values for the predictors with respect to the target variables and following values were obtained:

Based on the above correlation values only X4 number of convenience stores for further action.
